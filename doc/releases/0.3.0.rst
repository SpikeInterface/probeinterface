Jul, 30th 2025



Features
^^^^^^^^

* Use `ProbeTable <https://github.com/billkarsh/ProbeTable>`_ repo to generate NP probes information (#349, #355, #356)

.. warning::

    The ``model_name`` is now the IMEC model name (e.g. NP2003), while the long
    name is in the ``description`` annotation. Several new annotations have been added
    to the probe, such as ``num_channels_per_adc`` and ``num_readout_channels``.
    The ``mux_channels`` contact annotations now contains the ADC index for each channel,
    which can be used to compute inter sample shifts.

* Add figsize handler for ``plot_probegroup` (#350)

Bug fixes
